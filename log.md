Today's Progress: Working on the redux react tutorial, by Vaentino Gagliardi, at:
<https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-redux-tutorial-beginners/#React_Redux_tutorial_a_minimal_React_development_environment>

Thoughts: Decided to take the advice to start a second 100 days, as didn't get as far with redux as I had hoped. Great idea!

Day 2: Friday May 18, 2018

Today's Progress: Completed the tutorial at <https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-redux-tutorial-beginners/#React_Redux_tutorial_a_minimal_React_development_environment> described as:
React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2018)
The simplest React Redux tutorial I wish I had when I started learning (updated to webpack4!)

Thoughts: Good, but still getting confused trying to get it all. However, a lot of good explanations of why and how and what! Moving on to a tutorial on redux from the fullstack react book.
