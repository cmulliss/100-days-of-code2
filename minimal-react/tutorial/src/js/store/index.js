/* createStore is the function for creating the Redux store.
createStore takes a reducer as the first argument, rootReducer in our case.
You may also pass an initial state to createStore. But most of the times you donâ€™t have to. Passing an initial state is useful for server side rendering. Anyway, the state comes from reducers.
